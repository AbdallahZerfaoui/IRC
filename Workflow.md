Okay, you want to see the stepping stones that quickly lead to a visible sign of life from your server. This is a great approach to build confidence and understand the core loop before diving into complex protocol details.

Let's break the project into big, functional blocks, with each block culminating in a "display something" moment.

**The Core Idea:** A network server's simplest job is to listen, accept, receive, and send. We'll build that minimal loop first.

**Adherence to C++98:** Remember, even in these blocks, you *must* use C++98 and the specified system calls (`poll`, non-blocking I/O with `fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK)` ONLY, etc.).

---

**Block 1: The Listener is Alive!**

*   **Goal:** Start your server application and get the main listening socket up and running on the specified port, accepting command-line arguments.
*   **What you "Display":**
    *   Server starts without crashing.
    *   A message printed to the *server's console* showing it started listening on `<port>`.
    *   Using a system tool like `netstat`, you can verify that your server is listening on the given port.
*   **Core Tasks:**
    1.  Set up your Makefile (Challenge 0).
    2.  Parse command-line arguments (`<port>`, `<password>`) in `main()`. Handle errors if arguments are missing or invalid.
    3.  Inside your `Server` class (or main function for now), use `socket()` to create a TCP socket (IPv4 or IPv6).
    4.  Use `setsockopt()` (optional but good practice: `SO_REUSEADDR`).
    5.  Prepare the address structure (`sockaddr_in`).
    6.  Use `bind()` to assign the socket to the port.
    7.  Use `listen()` to put the socket into listening mode.
    8.  **Crucially:** Use `fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK)` to make this listening socket non-blocking.
    9.  Print a success message to the console.
    10. Keep the server running (an infinite loop for now, perhaps just calling `poll` with only the listening socket).
*   **Why this is the first step:** You can't do *anything* until the server can open a port and wait for connections. Getting the basic socket setup and argument parsing correct is foundational.

**Block 2: Hello, Client! (Connection & Disconnection Logging)**

*   **Goal:** Modify your server loop to accept incoming connections when the listening socket is ready and log when clients connect and disconnect.
*   **What you "Display":**
    *   When a client connects (e.g., using `nc 127.0.0.1 <port>`), a message is printed on the *server's console* like "Client connected. FD: [socket_descriptor]".
    *    When the client disconnects (e.g., you close `nc`), a message is printed like "Client disconnected. FD: [socket_descriptor]".
*   **Core Tasks:**
    1.  Introduce the `poll()` system call (Challenge 2). Manage a `std::vector<pollfd>`. Add the listening socket to this vector.
    2.  Create an infinite loop (`while(true)`) around the `poll()` call.
    3.  Inside the loop, check if the listening socket's `revents` has `POLLIN`.
    4.  If so, loop on `accept()` until it returns -1 with `EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK`. For each new file descriptor returned by `accept()`:
        *   **Crucially:** Use `fcntl(new_fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK)` to make the *new client socket* non-blocking.
        *   Add this new client file descriptor to your `pollfd` vector, also with `POLLIN` events requested.
        *   Print your "Client connected" message including the new file descriptor.
    5.  Inside the `poll` loop, after checking the listening socket, iterate through the *other* `pollfd` entries (the clients). If a client socket's `revents` has `POLLIN` or any error flag (`POLLERR`, `POLLHUP`, `POLLNVAL`):
        *   Print your "Client disconnected" message including the file descriptor.
        *   Remove this file descriptor from your `pollfd` vector.
        *   Use `close()` on the client socket file descriptor.
*   **Why this is the next step:** This establishes the server's ability to handle *multiple* connections. You see concrete output based on external client actions. This is the minimal event loop structure.

**Block 3: Talking Back (Receive Data & Simple Echo)**

*   **Goal:** Implement reading data from connected clients and sending data back.
*   **What you "Display":**
    *   When a client sends text, the *server's console* logs the received data: "Received from [FD]: [data]".
    *   The server sends a simple message back to the client, perhaps echoing what was received, or sending a hardcoded "Welcome!" when they connect.
*   **Core Tasks:**
    1.  Inside the `poll` loop, when a client socket's `revents` includes `POLLIN`:
        *   Use `recv()` on the socket. Read into a small buffer.
        *   Handle the return value:
            *   `> 0`: Data received. Append it to a receive buffer associated with this client (you'll need a data structure mapping FDs to client state/buffers now, like `std::map<int, ClientData>`). Print the received data to the server console.
            *   `0`: Client disconnected gracefully. Handle as in Block 2 (log, remove from `pollfd`, close socket, clean up client data).
            *   `-1` with `EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK`: No data yet, normal for non-blocking. Do nothing.
            *   `-1` with other errors: Handle as disconnection.
    2.  Implement logic to send data back. A simple way to "display" this is:
        *   When a client connects, immediately call `send()` to send a simple string like "Welcome to my IRC server!\r\n" to the `new_fd`. Handle `send`'s return value (it might not send everything at once - for this simple echo, just sending the first chunk is okay to see output, but a full implementation requires buffering).
        *   *OR*, after receiving data in step 1, call `send()` to echo the received data back to the same client socket.
    3.  Remember that `send()` is also non-blocking. If it returns -1 with `EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK`, you *would* need a send queue and `POLLOUT` handling (Challenge 4 detailed), but for this "display" block, just attempting one `send` is sufficient to see output in the client.
    4.  Test: Connect with `nc`. You should see the server log your connection, maybe receive an initial message, and when you type and press enter, you should see the server log what you typed and maybe echo it back.

**Block 4: Basic Protocol Interaction (PING/PONG)**

*   **Goal:** Your server should recognize a fundamental IRC command (`PING`) and respond correctly (`PONG`). This proves your server is starting to understand the IRC protocol structure.
*   **What you "Display":**
    *   Using an actual IRC client (or crafted `nc` input), send a `PING` command.
    *   The client receives a `PONG` response from your server.
*   **Core Tasks:**
    1.  Enhance your receive data handling (Block 3). After receiving data, check if the client's receive buffer contains a full IRC command (ends with `\r\n`). If yes, extract the command string.
    2.  Implement a simple parser: Just check if the extracted command *starts with* "PING " (case-insensitive).
    3.  If it's a PING command, parse the parameter (the token after "PING ").
    4.  Construct the correct `PONG` reply string: `PONG :<parameter_from_PING>\r\n`.
    5.  Use your sending logic (Block 3) to send this `PONG` reply back to the client that sent the PING.
    6.  For any other received command, you can just log it or ignore it for now.
    7.  Test: Use an IRC client (they often send PINGs automatically) or `nc` (`echo "PING :my.server.com\r\n" | nc 127.0.0.1 <port>`). Verify the client receives the `PONG` response.

**Block 5: IRC Client Recognition (Registration & Welcome)**

*   **Goal:** Your server will handle the basic IRC registration sequence (PASS, NICK, USER) and, upon success, send the standard welcome messages. This is the point where a standard IRC client will consider itself connected and show you in a "server messages" window.
*   **What you "Display":**
    *   Connect using your chosen reference IRC client.
    *   Provide the correct password, nickname, and username.
    *   The IRC client successfully completes connection and displays the server's welcome messages (RPL_WELCOME, etc.).
*   **Core Tasks:**
    1.  Refine your command parsing (Block 4) to properly extract the command name and its parameters according to IRC rules (handle prefixes, trailing parameters starting with ':'). Create a structure/class to hold the parsed command.
    2.  Create a `Client` class/struct to hold a client's state: socket FD, receive buffer, send queue, nickname, username, registration status (e.g., flags for PASS, NICK, USER received, and a final `is_registered` flag). Store these `Client` objects (remember C++98 manual management in a map mapping FD to client object or pointer).
    3.  Implement a command dispatcher that takes a parsed `Command` and the `Client` object that sent it.
    4.  Implement handlers for `PASS`, `NICK`, and `USER` commands:
        *   `PASS`: Check password against the server's expected password. Update client state.
        *   `NICK`: Validate nickname format, check if in use (initially, just check other connected clients' temp/registered nicks). Update client state.
        *   `USER`: Parse username/realname, update client state.
    5.  After *each* command, check if the client has now met all registration requirements (`PASS`, `NICK`, `USER` info provided). If yes, mark them as `is_registered=true`.
    6.  Upon successful registration (`is_registered` becomes true):
        *   Construct and send the required welcome messages (RPL_WELCOME, RPL_YOURHOST, RPL_CREATED, RPL_MYINFO). Look up their exact numeric codes and format in an IRC RFC (like RFC 1459 or 2812). Use your sending logic (Block 3) to send these replies *in order*.
    7.  Modify your command dispatcher: If a client is *not* registered, *only* allow PASS, NICK, USER, and QUIT. Any other command should result in an ERR_NOTREGISTERED reply.
    8.  Test: Connect with your IRC client. Follow the registration sequence. Test invalid passwords, duplicate nicks, invalid commands before registering. See if the client successfully connects and shows the welcome text.

**Moving Forward:**

Once you achieve Block 5, you have a server that can accept connections, handle basic I/O, parse commands, manage fundamental client state, and get a standard IRC client registered.

The subsequent challenges (Channels, Private Messages, Operators, Modes, Robustness) build upon this foundation by adding more complex state management (channels, memberships, operator flags) and implementing more commands that interact with this state.

This block-by-block approach lets you see tangible progress and debug core components (sockets, poll, basic I/O, basic parsing) before tackling the full complexity of the IRC protocol and channel logic.

Good luck! Focus on getting one block working well before moving to the next.
